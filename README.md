Sambhasha AI by Avishkaram Technologies is based in Microsoft Teams. 

 

Sambhasha AI listens, tracks and read conversations to assign tasks, provide help and summarize the conversation between team members in an organization. 

 

Sambhasha AI helps with Active Listening, where you can command the AI for help between conversation and it will provide you with links to resources, as it will be listening the conversation and understand what you are asking for. 

 

It also helps with summarizing conversation, this functions needs to be activated at the beginning of conversation, where the AI actively reads over every message and at the end summarizes the conversation when asked for. 

 

Sambhasha AI assists in adding particular tasks between conversation when someone is assigned during the talk. If you also state in a message that you'll be looking over one particular issue in conversation, Sambhasha AI will add that task in your Microsoft Planner. 

 

Besides that, Sambhasha AI can also assist you with Questions/Answers Feature where you can ask any questions and the AI will answer it.
